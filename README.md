# Dungeons together

[!IMPORTANT]
This project is in very early development !


## For short

This game will be a multiplayer 2D dungeon crawler.


## What's done ?

1. Basic network protocol
1. Basic UI library

## What's being done ?

1. The `uilang` procedural macro crate (enables to create UIs with a custom HTML-like markup language)
1. The connection menu

## What's to do ?

1. Make UI not ugly
1. Code the game (would be a nice idea)
